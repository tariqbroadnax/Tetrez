# Tetrez

Tetrez is a puzzle game based off of the classic puzzle game Tetris and popular indie game Fez. The title particularly is a pun based on this mash-up. Most of the game works exactly as how Tetris works. However, the player is able to rotate the board in the same way as the player is able to rotate the map in Fez. In adding this feature, many more types of gameplay can be explored.  

The game was created by Malik Webster, Keerti Banweer, and myself, Tariq Broadnax, as a group project for a Computer Graphics course. The goal of this project was to explore and implement as many graphical effects as possible. Some of the noteworthy graphical effects included in this project are the particle system used on the title screen, the fading transitions between screens, the rotation of the board, and the gameover fill effect.

While the project was not completed, many elements of a traditional game were implemented, particularly the title screen, menu screen, and gameplay screen. Proper transitions for these screens have already been implemented and the framework for high score screen and a credits screen have already been implemented into the main menu. Likewise, the framework for the screensaver on the title screen has also already been implemented. 

To minimize development time, all screens were designed in such a way as to mimic classic arcade games, particularly the dark backgrounds, white text, and blocky fonts.

The project was developed using JOGL and Java Swing. Swing was used to implement the user interface. JOGL was used to implement the center/main pane on the gameplay screen, specifically to implement 3d rotation effect that is used.

As of now, the project is on hold. However, in the future, the game may be finished, cleaned-up, and possibly published to some free game website for the world to explore.

* None of the creators take any credit for the creation of any particular assets (Please do not sue us).
* The source is missing the necessary JOGL jar files to run. These files will be uploaded at a later date.
